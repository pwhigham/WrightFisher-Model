# WrightFisher-Model
C code, network data and results running Wright-Fisher models on graphs

This repository holds the C code to model WF models on networks.  The data required is the networks/*/1.txt data.
The results are given for runs of 1,000,000 for estimating delta M and delta V, and 10,000 runs for fixation
This repository is setup as data for submission to PNAS (August 6th, 2021).
